PHP variable mutable/changeable:

In PHP, a variable is considered mutable if its value can be changed or altered after it has been initially assigned. This means, the value stored in the variable can be modified or reassigned at any point during the execution of a program. For example, the value of a mutable variable can be changed through assignment statements, increment/decrement operations, or by being passed as an argument to a function that modifies its value.
