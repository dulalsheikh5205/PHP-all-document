PHP Constants are immutable/not changeable:

In PHP, constants are considered immutable, which means that their values cannot be changed once they have been defined. Once a constant is defined using the 'define()' function or the 'const' keyword, its value remains the same throughout the execution of the program. Attempting to change the value of a constant will result in a runtime error.

Constants are typically used to store values, that are used throughout a program, such as configuration settings, commonly used values, or other values that's mean it remains constant. By using constant instead of variables, you can ensure that their values remain unchangeable, providing a more predictable and secure environment for your code.

==========For example: ==============

define("MY_CONSTANT", "Hello, world!");
echo MY_CONSTANT; // outputs "Hello, world!"

 Attempting to change the value of a constant will result in an error:

 MY_CONSTANT = "Goodbye, world!"; // Causes a fatal error


================= To create a constant, use the define() ==============

Syntax: define(name, value, case-insensitive)

Argument #3 is ignored since declaration of case-insensitive constants is no longer supported as of PHP 8.0.0

Parameters:

=> name: Specifies the name of the constant
=> value: Specifies the value of the constant
=> case-insensitive: Defining case-insensitive constants is deprecated as of PHP 7.3.0. As of PHP 8.0.0, only false is an acceptable value, passing true will produce a warning.

//Argument #3 is ignored since declaration of case-insensitive constants is no longer supported as of PHP 8.0.0

// define("NAME","Dulal",true);

define("NAME","Dulal Sheikh");
echo NAME;
echo "\n";

define("PI",3.14159);
//show constant value
echo PI;  //output = 3.14159
echo "\n";


//show constant value
echo constant("PI");  //output = 3.14159
echo "\n";


//constants cannot be directly embedded in string literal
echo "The PI value is PI ";  //output = The PI value is PI
echo "\n";

//constants cannot be directly embedded in string literal
echo "The PI value is {PI}";  //output = The PI value is {PI}
echo "\n";

//Using concatenation:
echo "The PI value is: ".PI;  //output = The PI value is {PI}: 3.14159
echo "\n";


//tricks to show define constant value in string
$constant = 'constant';
echo "The PI value is {$constant("PI")}\n";   //output = The PI value is 3.14159
echo "The PI value is {$constant("PI")}";   //output = The PI value is 3.14159
